    A goal-based environment. It functions just as any regular OpenAI Gym environment but it
    imposes a required structure on the observation_space. More concretely, the observation
    space is required to contain at least three elements, namely `observation`, `desired_goal`, and
    `achieved_goal`. Here, `desired_goal` specifies the goal that the agent should attempt to achieve.
    `achieved_goal` is the goal that it currently achieved instead. `observation` contains the
    actual observations of the environment as per usual.
